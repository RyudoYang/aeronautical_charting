# Aeronautical Charting
Resources for aeronautical charting, intention is to fill the gap between ICAO paper products and the need to use modern tools for charting but sometimes the icons and symbols are not there, as well other tools will be added along the way.

All SVG icons can be downloaded from the svg_icons folder
